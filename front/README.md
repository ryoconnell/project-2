Explanation: The purpose of the app to create the homepage of a pet sitting business.  The homepage would be similar to many small business websites.  It will have the basic features of a menu, contact box, description, photo, logo and rates.  These are things that would normally be found on different pages on the website, but since it's one page, I'll put in on the homepage.
I would like to be able to create websites for pet sitters, so this would be a test.
Approach - I've seen many pet sitter websites, so I have a general idea on what many pet sitters have on their homepage.  It will techinically be for pet sitters, but many small businesses have similar home pages.  The layout will be a standard design of menu on top, info in the middle and some content on the sides.  Most businesses wouldn't have a contact box, which I hope to have, on the homepage, but I'd like to have it.
I have code from APIs in class to create databases for the tic tac toe, so I hope to use something similar for the contact box.  I also have the Active Mailer from Active Record to send emails to myself when someone completes the box.
I like the idea of have one aspect where the visitor adds his/her info to become a user.  It wouldn't be needed in this project, but I could use it in the future on another project.  It could be the beginning of having a user make an online payment.
I plan on using more CSS than I did on the tic tac toe project.  I used very little CSS in that project, but I'm more comfortable with it.  I plan on using JavaScript when I have to, but I like creating a page with HTML/CSS more.  I'll meet the basic requirements for other languages.
The API will be troubling.  I have had difficulty with it, so I'll work on it after the front end.
There has been a lot of work over the last day.  I created a large poriton, perhaps larger than I thought.  The ajax was created based on the IMDB api created in class.  The tables are similar to mine.
As of the night before it is due...it isn't listed on Heroku, things won't update, and there may be a problem with the authentication.  The authenticaiton may have been solved with the online mentor program...not sure.

User Stories
1.  As a visitor, I want to learn more about the pet sitter so I that I can choose whether or not I will use him.
2. As a visitor, I want to see a professional website so that I believe the pet sitter appears to be professional and not an amateur.  I am more likely to choose a pet sitter with a nice website, than I am with someone with a poor site.  The state of the site reflects poorly on the pet sitter, even if the better pet sitter doesn't have a nice website.
3. As a visitor, I want to view the rates so that I can see if I can afford the pet sitter.
4. As a visitor, I want to enter my information into the contact box so that I can speak to the pet sitter.
